## 🏢 Professional Experience

### **Hyundai WIA** | *Vehicle HVAC Design Engineer*
*Changwon, South Korea | Jan 2024 - Present*

As a core engineer in the Thermal Management Systems (TMS) division, I lead the mechanical design and logic optimization of HVAC systems for next-generation Electric Vehicles (EVs).

**Key Responsibilities:**
* **EV Thermal Management Strategy:** Developed integrated thermal management logic to optimize energy efficiency in EVs, balancing cabin comfort with battery thermal requirements.
* **HIL/SIL Validation:** Conducted rigorous Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) simulations to validate control logic under extreme environmental conditions.
* **Component Design:** Led the design and mass-production engineering of HVAC components (BLDC motors, blowers, cooling loops), ensuring robust performance and durability.

**🏆 Key Achievements:**

> **1. Global Technical Presentation to General Motors (GM)**
> * Selected as the technical representative to present a new thermal control solution to GM engineering teams.
> * Successfully demonstrated the system's efficiency improvements, facilitating ongoing technical collaboration.

> **2. 2025 HMG Technical Conference**
> * **Paper:** *"A Study on the Temperature Control Performance..."* (논문 제목이 길면 앞부분만 쓰고 ... 처리해도 됩니다)
> * Presented research findings on optimizing HVAC control algorithms to minimize energy consumption in cold-weather conditions.
> * Recognized for proposing a novel logic that improves heating efficiency by XX% (수치 기억나시면 넣으세요, 없으면 이 줄 삭제).
