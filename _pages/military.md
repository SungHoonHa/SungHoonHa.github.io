## 🚁 KUH-1 Surion Crew Member
**Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) Aviation Operations Command**
*20XX.XX - 20XX.XX (복무 기간)*

### "Learning Systems Reliability in the Field"

While serving as a crew member on the **KUH-1 Surion**, a Korean indigenous utility helicopter, I gained invaluable insights into aerospace systems that cannot be learned in a classroom.

* **Operational Responsibility:** Responsible for pre-flight inspections and in-flight monitoring, ensuring the safety of the aircraft and personnel.
* **System Understanding:** Developed a practical understanding of complex mechanical and avionic systems operating under extreme conditions.
* **Safety First Mindset:** Learned the critical importance of safety protocols and maintenance procedures in high-stakes engineering environments.

This experience reinforced my desire to study **robust control systems** that guarantee safety and performance in dynamic environments.
