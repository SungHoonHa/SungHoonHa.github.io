# Hello, I am Sunghoon Ha.

I am an aspiring Ph.D. researcher specializing in **System Dynamics and Control**, with a unique background bridging **Thermal Management Systems** and **Robotics**.

Currently, I serve as a Vehicle HVAC Design Engineer at **Hyundai WIA**, where I lead the thermal management logic design for Electric Vehicles (EV). My work involves strict validation through HIL/SIL simulations and global collaboration, including technical presentations to **General Motors (GM)**. Recently, I shared my research insights on temperature control performance at the **2025 HMG Technical Conference**.

My academic foundation at **Korea Aerospace University (KAU)** and research internship at **UNLV (DASL)** grounded me in robotics and control theory. From developing control software for reusable rockets to operating as a **KUH-1 Helicopter Crew member**, I have consistently sought to understand complex engineering systems from both theoretical and operational perspectives.

I am eager to bring my industrial expertise and research passion to your program.
